    "bio": "Hey! I’m Julian, a software engineering graduate from general assembly. I’ve spent almost 10 years in various team based, customer facing positions, and gained an extensive repertoire of communication, team building and resource management skills. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working and traveling with incredibly diverse groups of people, and have a firm grasp on how to break down communication barriers between them. I’m currently proficient in javascript, html, css as well as several other languages and always striving to be on the cutting edge of current technologies despite my passion for retro pop culture."
